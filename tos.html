  THEIR DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, PARTNERS, AND AGENTS (TOGETHER, THE “CROWDME PARTIES”) 
  FROM ANY CLAIM, COMPLAINT, CAUSE OF ACTION, CONTROVERSY, OR DISPUTE (TOGETHER, “CLAIM”) 
  AND DAMAGES, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, RELATING TO, ARISING OUT OF, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED 
  WITH ANY SUCH CLAIM YOU HAVE AGAINST ANY THIRD PARTIES. YOU WAIVE ANY RIGHTS 
  YOU MAY HAVE UNDER CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE §1542, OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR APPLICABLE 
  STATUTE OR LAW OF ANY OTHER JURISDICTION, WHICH SAYS THAT:

  THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER OF CERTAIN DAMAGES AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY WILL APPLY TO THE 
  MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. THE LAWS OF SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS MAY 
  NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES, SO SOME OR ALL OF THE EXCLUSIONS 
  AND LIMITATIONS SET FORTH ABOVE MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY 
  IN OUR TERMS, IN SUCH CASES, THE LIABILITY OF THE WHATSAPP PARTIES WILL BE LIMITED TO THE FULLEST 
  EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>

  or (c) any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully as required by 
  us in the defense or settlement of any Claim.</p>

  state court located in Collin County in Texas, and you agree to submit to the personal 
  jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating all such Disputes.</p>

  Disputes, whether in court or arbitration, which might arise between CrowdMe and you, without regard 
  to conflict of law provisions.</p>
