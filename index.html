PlusOne app enables one to seek and get help from a set of pre-selected friends 
  and others who are willing to help.
<p>
One can select from their facebook friends (who have also installed PlusOne app
on their mobile devices) and add them to one's Safety Squad.
<p>
When help is desired, simply swipe on the icon in the home page. It instantly
notifies your friends (on the Safety Squad) and others within a five mile radius
that you need some assistance. Your friends or those willing to help you can
respond to your request. The PlusOne app guides them to your
location via Google Maps. Even if you move after seeking help, the app will
guide them to your current location.
<p>
This is the alpha test version of the app. Please send any comments and suggestions
to Krithika Iyer.
