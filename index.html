PlusOne app helps one get help from friends and others (who are willing to help).
One can select from their facebook friends (who have also installed PlusOne app
on their mobile devices) and add them to one's Safety Squad.
<p>
When help is desired, simply swipe on the icon in the home page. It instantly
notifies your friends (on the Safety Squad) and others within a five mile radius
that you need some assistance. The app guides those willing to help to your
location via Google Maps.
<p>
This is the alpha test version of the app. Please send any comments and suggestions
to Krithika Iyer.
