Why don't I see all my Facebook Friends when I try to add friends to my Safety Squad list?
<pr>
Due to recent Facebook restrictions, you can add only those Facebook friends who have already
installed the PlusOne app to their mobile device. If you do not see the Facebook friends you
want to add to your Safety Squad, please ask them to add the PlusOne app (and during this pre-release
test, please request Krithika Iyer to add them to the list of testers so they get the link)
<p>
<br>
Your information will NOT be shared with any third parties. Also we will delete all requests
for help within a week unless you explicitly want to save information about a particular call.
<p>
This is the pre-release alpha test version of the app. Please send any comments and suggestions
to Krithika Iyer.
