  How can I help others who may need assistance?
  <br>
  On the home screen of the app, tap the upward looking arrow at the bottom of the screen.
It will allow you to "Join the Crowd" (for 90 minutes at a time) - you will receive a
  notification (along with location and navigation info) when someone within a mile of
  your current location seeks assistance. You may "Leave the Crowd" anytime.

 Why don't I see all my Facebook Friends when I try to add friends to my Safety Squad list?
<br>
Due to recent Facebook restrictions, you can add only those Facebook friends who have already
installed the CrowdMe app to their mobile device. If you do not see the Facebook friends you
want to add to your Safety Squad, please ask them to install the CrowdMe app. After they
install the app, you will be able to add them to your Safety Squad.
</p>
<p>
Does the app also notify those who are not my friends (on Facebook or otherwise known to me)?
<br>
The app tries to leverage the existence of a a large pool of concerned people who want to prevent 
sexual assault of any kind. The app notifies those who are willing to help others. All such 
volunteers within a mile radius are notified. Imagine being on a first date at a restaurant,
and suspecting that your data may have put a "date rape" drug in your drink. A simple swipe
can discretely alert others (willing to help) in the same restaurant. Even before heading to
a first date, you can check to see how many volunteers may be having dinner at a restaurant!
There is stength in numbers and the app tries to leverage help from like minded "strangers".

<p>
Why do you delete all data within seventy two hours?
<br>
The primary goal of the app is to ensure that no one in a vulnerable position is exploited. A
person may be drunk or near drunk and we want to encourage and enable such a person to seek
help from others. In this context, we want to provide a platform that is judgement free. We
want people to use the app without having to worry about "does this app count how many times
I have gotten drunk in a week (month, year)..." Our aim is to promote a safe environment, free
of sexual harassment and assault. We DELETE DATA to ensure total and complete privacy. Only
user can take steps (within seventy two hours of the incident) to save the data.
</p>
<p>
Your information will NOT be shared with any third parties. Also we will delete all requests
for help within a week unless you explicitly want to save information about a particular call.
